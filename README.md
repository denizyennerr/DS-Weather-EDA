ðŸ“Š Highlights of Our Project: 
Investigated weather trends across Spain, Brazil, and Indonesia.
Identified key correlations between temperature, humidity, precipitation, and UV index to predict extreme events like wildfires, flooding, and heatwaves.
Cleaned and visualized a large weather dataset, analyzing over 32,000 rows of data from 205 countries.

Key Insights:
â€¢ Spain faces increasing heatwaves due to Mediterranean climatic conditions.
â€¢ Brazil sees challenges from wildfires and flooding, significantly impacting air quality and public health.
â€¢ Indonesia is vulnerable to rising sea levels, affecting agriculture and infrastructure.

Future Applications: Our findings can be further used for predictive models using machine learning to enhance climate resilience, develop actionable public policies, and support sustainable practices globally. ðŸŒ±
